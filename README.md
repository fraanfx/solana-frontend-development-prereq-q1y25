# Turbin3 Frontend Course Prerequisites
Hey there! This repository was designed orignally by [Nathan Galindo](https://twitter.com/_zebedee_) on behalf of [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/) for their frontend course. It has since been condensed and modernized for the Turbin3 Frontend Course. To successfully complete the prerequisites, you will need to fork this repository and complete the two projects in the repository.

# Walkthrough

A written walkthrough for both projects can be found [HERE](https://themenagerie.xyz/prerequisites/frontend)

# Video Series
The original repository is paired with a video series what walks you through each project. This video is relevant to the Send Sol project. [Click this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLdETmFewPI&list=PLMZny7wGLM6w4t7pMGATxFTjjMduTsEiF&index=5) to follow along. NOTE: This video is outdated and does not match the code in the repository. Following the video directly will not help you complete the project.

# Tech Stack
This course focuses on front-end development, and challenges you to build small applications using industry standard front-end technologies as well as some web3 frameworks to interact with the [Solana JSON RPC API](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCZyftNFV4i4Sygxkr6LdPazw2sLMPyhQbVqFID-yy8QSqf81dxJHUoaAk2ZEALw_wcB). Listed below are the main frameworks and tools you will be working with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)
- [solana/spl-token](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/index.html)
- [solana/wallet-adapter-react](https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/)

The frameworks and tools used to build out these projects were carefully selected because they are the tools real companies are using in the blockchain industry to build out production applications. Even though they may be new to you, becoming familiar with them will greatly benefit your hireability as a software engineer (both within, and beyond the blockchain industry)!

# Getting Started
Navigate to a folder in your local environment and copy/paste the following commands into your terminal:
```
  git clone [YOUR_FORKED_REPO_URL]
  cd solana-frontend-development-course
  nvm install 20
  nvm use 20
  yarn
  yarn dev
```
At this point, the repository should be installed to your computer and hosted on your browser at http://localhost:3000.

# Workflow
For each project, there is a card which contains a brief description of the project, as well as two buttons: "preview" and "starter". 
* The "preview" button, when clicked, will direct you to a finished version of the project. This is for your reference as you build the project on your own. 
* The "starter" button, when clicked, will take you to a blank page. The pages labeled "starter.jsx" within your repository are blank files that you will use to build out your own version of the given project.
